In an effort to make it easier for Windows users to use my Python apps, here are some brief
instructions for installing the necessary prerequisite software, as well as configuring
and running my apps themselves.

1) Install the base Python programming language interpreter:

- visit the following website: https://github.com/dieterv/pygtk-installer
- download/run one of the versions (currently a choice between '2.6' and '2.7')
  e.g. 'http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi' for version 2.6
       'http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi' for version 2.7
- after this is done, you should be able to test Python in a 'shell' (via 'python.exe')

2) Install an 'all-in-one' PyGTK extension package:

- click the 'Downloads' button on the same webpage
- download/run a matching version of 'pygtk-all-in-one'
  e.g. 'pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.0.win32-py2.6.msi' if you installed version 2.6
       'pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.0.win32-py2.7.msi' if you installed version 2.7

3) [Optionally] install the Graphviz graph visualization software package:

- visit the following website: http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
- download/run Graphviz for Windows
  e.g. 'graphviz-2.26.3.msi'

4) Install 'MGedcom' application (what this is all about!):

- visit the following website: https://sites.google.com/site/darethehair/home/software
- download/run the zipfile version of MGedcom
  e.g. https://sites.google.com/site/darethehair/home/software/mgedcom_076.zip

5) Move the '.mgedcom' directory directly under your private Windows user home directory
   e.g. 'C:\Documents and Settings\yourusername\'

6) You should now be able to start the application by clicking on the 'mgedcom.py' icon.
   Alternatively, you should be able to invoke it on the command line while in that directory:
   e.g. python.exe mgedcom.py
